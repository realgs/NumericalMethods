This program lets you create your own Cryptocurrency database and then lets you interact with it. 

Quick star guide:

1. Run the Main.py file. 

2. You shouldn't worry about case sensitivity. It doesn't matter if you type btc or BTC. 

3. Entering the resources is quite easy:

	For example: Enter the name of the resource: BTC
	       	     Enter the quantity of the resource: 0.1

4. With Value Check after entering 4 you can specify the currency USD or EUR.

5. Adding a resource works the same way as Entering does, but Entering wipes the CSV file.

6. To delete you just type the name of the crypto. 

7. Editing the quantity works similarly to Entering/Adding:

	Your resources are: 
	BTC 0.1

	Which resource would you like to change? BTC
	What's the new quantity? 0.7

8. The 'resources.csv' file is the database of your cryptos. 

9. You can type 'q' to exit of a mode, and when you are in the main menu 'q' closes the program.
